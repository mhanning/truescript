# 🧠 Truescript
> An honest programming language for a world that doesn't dare to be honest.

Truescript is a satirical superset of JavaScript and TypeScript that refuses to lie. 
It detects not only syntactical errors, but also emotional inconsistencies. 
It's the first language that asks you: 
**"Why are you *really* doing this?"**

## ✨ Features

- **Emotional Typing**: Variables like `truthy`, `needy`, or `burnedOut`.
- **New Keywords**: `why`, `regret`, `cope`, `excuse`.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Detects herd instinct, savior complexes, and self-deception.
- **Commit Analysis**: Translates euphemistic Git messages into plain text.
- **Zen Mode**: Locks your editor after 6 hours and plays Lo-Fi music.
